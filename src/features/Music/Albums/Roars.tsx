          A stray cat wandering in the dead of the night. Instincts that were
          once deeply buried are coming back. Flirting with danger. Feeling
          free... This isn't exactly your regular wildlife documentary. Itâ€™s
          Heavy Metal.

          Wreck Plus is back for some high speed, heavy and greasy rocking on
          this maxi single. This is an annunciation a full opus predicted for
          the future.
